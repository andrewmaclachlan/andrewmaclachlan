### Hi there 👋 I'm Andy MacLachlan

## 📖 About me

* I'm an Associate Professor in spatial data science and visualisation at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London.
* My expertise lies in remote sensing, although in recent years this has expanded to any project using spatial data and geographical information science.
* R is my language of choice, but i also use PostGIS and Google Earth Engine

> "A jack of all trades is a master of none, **but oftentimes better than a master of one**"

## 🏗️ What i'm doing

### 👨‍🏫 Teach
I supervise doctoral researchers, MSc students and lead two MSc modules:
* [Geographic information systems and science](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/)
* [Remotely sensing cities and environments](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/)

I run CASA's [MSc Urban Spatial Science programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/study/urban-spatial-science-msc)

### 🔎 Research
My research revovles around developing data-driven urban development recommendations to enhance future sustainability and optimise resource investment. This has included work on Urban Heat Islands and more recently water accessibility in Tanzania using PostGIS.

> If it's not applied, i'm not interested. 

### 💰 Scholarships / other
I apply and maintain a range of scholarship funding for our MSc, including:
* [Office for Students Conversion Course funding (Urban Futures)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/study/scholarships/casa-urban-futures-masters-scholarships)
* [Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Scheme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarship-scheme#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20Commonwealth,study%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom.)

I teach at other institutions a few times a year, this has included the MSc Modelling for Global Health and the University of Oxford and a guest workshop at IIT Hyderabad.
